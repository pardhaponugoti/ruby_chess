# Chess

This is a program I wrote in which you can play Chess in your Terminal.  The game
logic was written entirely in Ruby and incorporates the following concepts:

* Class Inheritance
* Exceptions and Error Handling
* Encapsulation
* DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself!

### How to Play

In order to play, you will need to install Ruby.

This [guide](http://installrails.com/steps) will walk you through the installation.

Once Ruby is installed, download the files and navigate to the containing folder in Terminal.
Use the following command to start the game:

`ruby game.rb`
